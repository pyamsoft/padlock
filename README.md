# DEPRECATED

With the coming changes in Android Q which affect how Activities can launch  
from the background, PadLock is effectively dead.

I will not be able to continue development as it feels like applications which  
try to do what PadLock did are not welcome anymore in the Android ecosystem.

There will be no more bugfixes or features in this codebase. The store page will  
stay live until Android Q releases, or I am forced to take it down - whichever  
comes first.

Thank you.
